# 🎗️ Cancer Data Analysis – Gaining Insights from Patient Data

A data analysis project aiming to uncover patterns between tumor types, stages, demographics, smoking, treatments, and survival status.


## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Kaggle – China Cancer Records](https://www.kaggle.com)
- **Size**: Thousands of patient records
- **Features**: Demographics, tumor type, stage, treatment, smoking, survival, etc.


## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze tumor type distribution by age and gender  
- Understand impact of smoking on tumor size and survival  
- Explore cancer stage vs treatment and survival  
- Identify high-risk groups and late diagnoses


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📊 Key Visual Insights

1. **Cancer Stage by Age & Gender**:  
   - Females are diagnosed earlier on average  
   - Gender-based diagnosis gap may relate to awareness or behavior  

2. **Tumor Type by Smoking & Gender**:  
   - Active smokers show larger tumor sizes  
   - Males have higher proportions in smoking-related cancers  

3. **Survival Status by Cancer Stage**:  
   - 100% survival in early stages (I & II)  
   - Under 50% survival in late stages (III & IV)


## 🧠 Main Takeaways

- Early detection greatly improves survival  
- Smoking strongly linked to more aggressive tumors  
- Gender affects treatment type but not survival rate directly  
- Cancer stage and tumor type are key survival predictors  


## 🔮 Future Work

- Add genetic/lifestyle data  
- Build a survival prediction model  
- Create an interactive dashboard
